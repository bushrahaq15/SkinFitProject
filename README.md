# SkinFitProject
SkinFit is a basic skincare routine recommender developed in C. Based on the user's skin type (Oily, Dry, Combination, or Sensitive) and time of day (Day or Night), it suggests a simple, customized skincare routine. The goal is to offer quick guidance for users unsure about suitable products or routine structure.
